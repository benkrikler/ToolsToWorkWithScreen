ScreenTools
===========

Tools to work and use screen more efficiently

== ConnectScreen.sh == 

I use this under an alias in my .bashrc (eg. scr)
the script asks screen for all sessions running, then prints that, 
and allows you to select from the list with a number, from 1 to the number of screen sessions, inclusive.
You can also pass it that number on the command if you already know the session that you want to reconnect to.
